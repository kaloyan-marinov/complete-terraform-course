# HashiCorp Terraform

`Terraform` is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently.

`Terraform` is an infrastructure-as-code tool, which means that it allows you to

- _declare_ your entire cloud infrastructure as a set of configuration files (written in the "HashiCorp Configuration Language" [HCL]),

- which then the tool `Terraform` provision and manage on our behalf (by interacting with your cloud provider's API)

`Terraform` can interact with pretty much every cloud provider, which you may decide to rely on for the purpose of deploying your web application.
